## Mod Features
BloodyEncounters elevates gameplay by injecting an element of unpredictability and formidable challenges. As players venture outside their castles, there's a chance a random NPC will spawn nearby. You can customize the NPC level difference, ensuring balanced encounters for all players. This mod is highly configurable, offering an array of options to tailor the experience to your preferences.

## Requirements:

For the correct functioning of this mod you must have the following dependencies installed on your server:

1. [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/v-rising/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_V_Rising/)
2. [Bloodstone](https://thunderstore.io/c/v-rising/p/deca/Bloodstone/)
3. [VampireCommandFramework](https://thunderstore.io/c/v-rising/p/deca/VampireCommandFramework/)
4. [Bloody.Core](https://thunderstore.io/c/v-rising/p/Trodi/BloodyCore/)

## Installation
1. Copy `BloodyEncounters.dll` to your `BepInEx/Plugins` directory.
2. Launch the server once to generate the config file; configurations will be located in the `BepInEx/Config` directory.

## Commands
It's crucial to note that for any command containing a name argument such as `<NameOfNPC>`, `<ItemName>` or `<GroupName>`, if your name consists of more than one word, include it inside `""` to ensure proper functionality (e.g., "Rifle Man" or "Blood Rose Potion").

  - **PrefabGUIDOfNPC**: The GUID of the NPC you prefer to use.

  - **LifeTime**: The duration the player has to kill the NPC encounters in seconds.
  - **Group** ( Optional ): If you give it a group value, when this NPC touches it it spawns all the NPCS in that group..
